                <h2>Moscow, Russia</h2>
                <p>My first time living abroad was during my study abroad semester in Moscow, Russia. Since I studies Russian in undergrad, it was essential that I travel to this mysterious country in order to get a feel for the culture and customs of the people there. I studied in Moscow State Humanities University and took many wonderful classes which helped me improve my Russian speaking abilities.</p>

                <h2>Voronezh, Russia</h2>
                <p>After graduating from Truman State University in Kirksville, MO, I was awarded a Fulbright grant which allowed me to live and work in a different Russian city for a full academic year. I was assigned to Voronezh, a mid-size city south of Moscow, near the border with Ukraine. Here I taught English in Voronezh State University and made several friends from all over Europe.</p>

                <h2>Tartu, Estonia</h2>
                <p>At the end of my time in Russia, my friend Heidi convinced me to apply for a Master's Degree program at the University of Tartu in Estonia. If you've never heard about Estonia, I'm not surprised. I didn't know much about it myself before moving there. Estonia is a tiny country in Northeastern Europe, west of Russia, north of Latvia, south of Finland. With a population of only 1.3 million, it is quite small and thus easy to get around and explore. I was accepted into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">Semiotics</a> program at the University, so I packed up my things and moved next door to Estonia to begin my two-year-long studies.</p>

                <h2>St. Louis, MO</h2>
                <p>After finishing the Master's program in Estonia, with my shiny new degree in hand, I decided to move back home to St. Louis. After three years abroad, I was feeling a bit homesick. I had missed holidays and special events and had scarcely seen my family and friends, so I knew it was time to come home. Since returning home I have been searching for the next step in all sorts of different directions. Will Launchcode be the stepping stone that leads to the next path? Only time will tell.</p>
